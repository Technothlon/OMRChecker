FAAADU README TODOs- 
DO NOT SEE EXISTING READMEs FOR FIRST ITERATION
	> ALWAYS YOUR ROOKIE MISTAKE. HOW'D YOU LEVEL UP OTHERWISE!!

# WHY IS THIS PROJECT FREE?
> Put the BTP certificate with IITG logo.
There isn't much progress in this area. This starting code is an incentive for people to step into this domain and make useful software for everyone

> Don't reinvent the wheel, use good wheels to make great vehicles!

Techno is non-profit?
You want to take things to next level

# What contributors can learn from this project?
Great learning experience to up your game in CV
When ML cannot easily bring solution to your table, CV never fails to impress!
Out of the box use cases of techniques such as morphology(mostly used in object detection), adaptive thresholding(and outlier detection), reverse perspective transform
Fully documented code
Access to the android application to show off 
Dedicated Discord channel for doubts as well as open discussions
Work on live challenges faced here

THEME: ROBUST N FAST
	All gifs should be realtime.
	Stacks should reflect robust

Mention runnable on Linux as well as Windows

Move some part to Wiki page
Images to generate(Gif + 2 level Stack)
	(Windows) > Connect to them using the hough circle methods. TAKE THAT IMAGE!
	// > Inputs scanned
	// > Normal cases working 
	// > Xerox cases working
	// > Stacks?!
	// > level 6 Rich Outputs (each type of plot)
	// > Inputs mobile
	// > Mobile image working gif and Stack
	// > CSV screenshot(take from report)
	// > One hist-only difference of mobile(take from report)
	[]> Alignment gif!! (use mobile images)
	[]> noMarkers: Different layout case
	[]> Fail cases grid: epic fails, Print Quality cases
	[]> (Single QBlock) Flow of template gen

	// Resolve existing multiMarked Genuines

	// do run convertLQ again, you can leave it for the day. Will not regret later. 

	Get the MoveDel Filenames by Roll number links from old note_stud_errs multimarked, error and result. 
>> ^ Rather code this in main.py itself! <<

	delete from all there, then reassign the seq numbers
